  Philosophy
  ==========
  * frontend - none, this baby is all command line
  * backend -
    * there's a database....
    * and a couple javascript files....
    * node modules, `.gitignore`, `package.json`, all the usual suspects


  Struggles
  =========
  Really, things went pretty smoothly.  Started with customer, and wrote that in about an hour and a half, and without much difficulty.  

  The manager one took a little longer.  I didn't figure out a clean way to keep running through the logic.  I wrote a little `runAgain()` function and called it, but it doesn't work exactly the way I wanted it too displaying the information and what not.

  Ideas for Improvement
  =====================
  Try and tackle that last piece.  It doens't look too bad, I just ran out of time.

  Styling
  =======
  really like that little `cli-table` node app.  Makes the tables look a lot cleaner.  Shout out to Lance for showing me that one.
